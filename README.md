# Project Name "Alarm App"

This is a beginner-level project where I developed a functional alarm app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app enables users to set a specific time for an alarm, which rings accordingly. As an initial practice project, the focus was solely on functionality rather than UI/UX design.
